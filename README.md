# sisifo-ruy-andrade
Chrome extension for automation of a Lawyer's office (suited for specific customer, not useful for general public without many customizations)

This extension combines trafic handling, data scrapping and the use of dozens of endpoints from RESTful APIs (mainly from Google Sheets and ProjurisAdv) to help
registering automatically new lawsuits valued info to the client's internal system (Projuris), as well as the needed workflow actions.

Built part with React, part with vanilla javascript, and bundled with webpack.
